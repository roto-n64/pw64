# PilotWings 64 Mission (Task) Editing Tools

UPWT is internal code for (what we believe to be) "Ultravision PilotWings Task". This was deduced based on various strings throughout the ROM.

A UPWT "file" is a form of "container" with definitions for things such as the level model to load, the vehicle to be used, weather/time, a task's objects (e.g. how many Balloons or Rings are loaded in test), takeoff/landing locations, level end destinations, etc.
A UPWT file is complimentary to UWPL which sets up some environmental things such as Audio triggers, Birdman Bonus star, "toys" (animated objects such as Oil Pump or water wheel), etc.

This repo contains some rough code to help understand and modify UPWT data and some scripts are described below.

## pw64_upwt_parser.py
A script to dump and translate various facts about individual game missions (called "Test" in game, "tasks" in game code).
It will give you floating point coordinates of objects (such as Rings/Ballons/Landing Strips/etc).
It will show information about each specific object(ive) if there are multiples such as >1 Ring.
It will attempt to decode the object attributes ("what color is the balloon?", "how big is the ring?").
This code now also dumps out a rough approximation of the task data (UPWT setup) to JSON format with the extension of the given Task ID (e.g. "E_GC_1.json")

Here's a parsed representation of the Beginner RocketPack level, it's various attributes, some coordinates for things, and the target object (Balloon) the task contains:

The script tries to and mostly works on parsing and decoding a lot of data, but there's still lots of work to do.
You can use it to your advantage such as say dumping and vimdiff'ing arrays of data between different tasks to see what values differ, then work through the differences in a debugger.

It can also be helpful to find things specific to a task. Such as lets find which missions you battle Meca Hawk in:
```

So looks like B_GC_3 and P_GC_3. Yay! Yes, I know there's a problem with the output that makes grep think it is binary data (thus a pipe to *strings* is needed). And this operation could probably be written into a function quite easily...

## pw64_lib.py
This is a module that has some functions shared between a few scripts.
It has functions to construct and show a table of the "filesystem" with file types, sizes and offsets (it parses TABL chunk and sticks the files/sizes/offsets indexed by int into a dictionary). It has a func that can show all files in the FS or specific file types as requested, it can decompress/update/re-compress the TABL chunk (MIO0 compressed) with new file sizes after modification, can encoded/decode ADAT (game strings), can patch the game code with new FS size offsets so that DMA reads have proper addresses (otherwise if you add data to the ROM, the hardcoded offsets all break!), and much, much more.

## pw64_taskmod_poc.py (Old...)
This script is my attempt at modifying a task and hard-patching a new object into an already existing task in the ROM.
The task is "E_GC_1" which is the Beginner GyroCopter level. 
It has 3 rings to fly through.
I've inserted a poppable Ballooon that I took out of the Beginner Rocket Pack level.

This script was a test to see if the following would work:
1) Adding an object to a mission from another mission (This one normally only has 3 Rings but now we add a Balloon on top of the castle).
2) Making that object visible by modifying the COMM section as needed. (If there's 0 balloons defined in COMM, and even if the BALS data is in the UPWT chunk, the balloon won't show)
3) Resizing the "filesystem".
4) Hard-patching various addresses in the game program code that reference specific FS sizes and offsets. 

The modifications worked in an Emulator and the patched ROM works on real N64 hardware.

## pw64_taskmod_json_poc.py (New!)
For the most part it duplicates the script above but this code now ingests JSON produced by the *pw64_upwt_parser.py* tool and attempts to re-build a UPWT from scratch with the given input.

This script should be able to add object(ive)s dynamically by letting the user create or modify a JSON file.
As of right now it is only able to add/remove Balloons and Rings to one level. You can't insert other object(ive)s because they're not parsed or exported by the parser tool. This is very much a WIP.

Here's an example of a modified E_GC_1 (Beginner GyroCopter test) task expressed in JSON format.
This JSON data represented here modifies this test to have a total of 5 Rings and 2 Balloons.
Data that is not yet decoded or requires more processing, such as with a lookup table, remains in Hex:

Here's what the above JSON looks like once parsed, processed and injected back into the ROM:

And finally here's a video of this in action:

[![Mod#5 video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YK3L8eoG3ts/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK3L8eoG3ts)

You can see there's now 5 rings instead of 3 and two balloons atop the castle in the Beginner GyroCopter test/mission.

## Q&A
**Q**: Does this work on N64 hardware?

**A**: Yes. The "filesystem" table (TABL chunk) is updated with the modified task's new size and then re-compressed, new data is injected at the proper offset(s), ROM padding is truncated if necessary (to maintain original ROM filesize), various addresses are patched in the game code to account for the modified FS size, and the ROM's checksum is fixed. It works.

**Q**: Why aren't you doing a full **DeCoMp** like all the cool kids are doing these days?

**A**: I don't know MIPS assembly. It took me two weeks to hunt down and patch the addresses that need to be modified when resizing the FS and injecting things into the ROM. I think I chose a pretty interesting portion of the game engine (the "tasks") and that has taken me >5 months (when I could find time!) to learn and get to the point where I can do what I am doing here.

**Q**: Why is your code bad/not OOP/repetitive/etc/etc?

**A**: Because I'm not a Software Developer or Software Engineer, this is a hobby. Feel free to take over and fix it yourself.

**Q**: Why don't you continue updating the NOCLIP Wiki and more document more details on things you've found/learned?

**A**: I can barely stomach writing documentation for my day job. I'm not particularly excited to do this for a hobby. Maybe if I find some extra time after I'm done exploring...

**Q**: What's next?

**A**: More JSON work... need to export all the other objects. More research on various object attributes (not everything is decoded). I need to figure out where the final scores are stored in a task (right now you can have 100 rings and only get points for 3 when you finish the test). So... a LOT of stuff.
