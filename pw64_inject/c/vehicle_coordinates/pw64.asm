;;; X / Y / Z Coordinates HUD Injection PoC by roto
; 
; In this patch we'll be printing the player's world coordinates while in-flight.
; We replace some code in the function used to print "Start!" when the mission begins.
; This section will load our code from ROM to RAM.
;
; We also replace a small chunk of code normally used to check whether or not to 
; display the N64 pad (as seen during demo flights) to instead run our code continuously.
;
; *** Notes ***:
; A good to-do would be to rewrite the "Start!" display func in our code as it's now gone.
; Also demo flights are now broken because of this! (lulz, will fix later?).
; Ok a LOT of stuff is broken because of this patch as the game keeps clearing 0x8038CCC8. Oh well, PoC.
; Should probably find another location to store this? Or find another function for injection.
; Ugh, I'll clean this up and make it clearer later.
