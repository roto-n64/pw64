Testing some SM64-style (https://github.com/shygoo/sm64-c-injection) code injection.

Contains two directories:
* asm:
    - a simple armips example to show a message on the start screen.
* c:
    - injection_test: same as ASM example above but now in C
    - intro_banner: prints some text above the PW64 logo on the start screen
    - vehicle_coordinates: prints player's world X/Y/Z coordinates in-game


Tools you need:
  - armips: https://github.com/Kingcom/armips
